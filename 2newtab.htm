<!-- 2021 Apr 11. Moved out of newtab.htm because on mbnuc I found myself
absent-mindedly clicking one of these next anchor elements, which immediately
brings up a SERP, the first hit of which I absent-mindedly click, then I click
to the parent of that comment, etc. And this is far from the first time that
has happened. In other words, I am removing these next 3 from mbnuc because I
tend to use these next 3 links to graze HN.-->
