# 2021 Mar 20. this has a flaw: if we used github.com to edit the repo, then
# the push command below will prol fail: we prol need to pull before we can
# successfully push.

# we had `rustdoc *.md -o .` here, but that is wrong because rustdoc can
# take only one input file.

git commit -a -m '--'
git push -u origin master
