# 2021 Mar 20. this prol has a flaw: if we used github.com to edit the repo,
# then the push command below will prol fail: we prol need to pull before we
# can successfully push.

# we had `rustdoc *.md -o .` here, but that is wrong because rustdoc can
# take only one input file.

git commit -a -m '--'
git push -u origin master

# The files will be published at https://hruvulum.github.io/

# This repo is mirrored at https://github.com/hruvulum/hruvulum.github.io
