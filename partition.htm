last updated 2021 Mar 20. all 3 8-giggers and the 16-gigger are currently at
ewater.

the most recent dup goes here.

8-gig cruzer #2. _partial_ dup made 2020 Apr 25: partial because the device
ran out of space. does not for example contain /v. stored at ewater (in the
water pik box IIRC).

the only big partition (partition 3) on hdmm2. btrfs dups made 2021 Mar 23
and 2021 Mar 20.

partitions 1 and 2 on the nvme drive have dups made 2021 Mar 12 or 13.

8-gig cruzer #3. dup made 2021 Mar 11 using tar.

also /o/dup/full/ on hdtera contains 8-gig dups. e.g., one made 2020 Apr 14.

the pre-mar 2021 dups were made with `tar cf /dev/rdisk3 -T /c/dupt` unless
otherwise specified.

8-gig cruzer #1. Silverblue 34 prerelease 2.6-gig install iso file.

16-gig tiny stainless drive. Fedora 34 prerelease everything (netinst) install

if you run tar as non-root, it will convert the owner of the extracted files to
the invoking user. if run as root, it will preserve the ownership data in the
archive (but that behavior can be overridden with flags).
