this file has the extension "htm" because I do not know how to configure github
pages to publish with the extension "txt"..

information on the contents of our media kept separate from our computer. vlm0

add 2021 Jul 15. all external drives including the 3 8-giggers and the 16
gigger are at cata.

the most recent dup goes here.

2021-07-20. 8-gig cruzer #2. dup of /da made as follows. I used Gnome Files to
format the entire volume (/dev/sdb, not /dev/sdb2 or such) as LUKS ext4. then I
made a tarball as follows (advantage: I could check the approximate space
requirements quickly) then untarred the ball into a subdirectory of the newly
formatted volume.

    cd / && time sudo tar -c -f da.tar --exclude=dup_btr ./da

2021-03-23. the only big partition (partition 3) on hdmm2. btrfs dups made 2021
Mar 23 and 2021 Mar 20.

2021-03-13. partitions 1 and 2 on the nvme drive have dups made 2021 Mar 12 or 13.

8-gig cruzer #3. dup made 2021 Mar 11 using tar.

also /o/dup/full/ on hdtera contains 8-gig dups. e.g., one made 2020 Apr 14.

the pre-mar 2021 dups were made with `tar cf /dev/rdisk3 -T /c/dupt` unless
otherwise specified.

8-gig cruzer #1. Silverblue 34 prerelease 2.6-gig install iso file.

16-gig tiny stainless drive. Fedora 34 prerelease everything (netinst) install
iso file. used to install what I am using now.

if you run tar as non-root, it will convert the owner of the extracted files to
the invoking user. if run as root, it will preserve the ownership data in the
archive (but that behavior can be overridden with flags).
