all of these dups were made with `tar cf /dev/rdisk3 -T /c/dupt` unless
otherwise specified.

8-gig cruzer #1. dup made 2019 Jul 31. stored at cata.

8-gig cruzer #2. dup made 2020 Apr 20. in the clever right corner of the
hallway cubby where I used to keep a comb. [[[del: heavily used starting Mar or
Apr 2019 to support commuting between mbmm and mbec. formatted ExFAT. :del]]]

8-gig cruzer #3. dup made 2019 Nov 11. stored at cata. I tried something new
and used dd rather than (bsd) tar to write to the backup media. dd took over 8
hours.

also /o/dup/full/ on hdtera contains 8-gig dups. e.g., one made 2020 Apr 14.

to boot from a usb drive, press and hold the option (alt) key immediately upon
hearing the startup chime. release the key after Startup Manager appears.

when restoring from a backup, don't forget the "sudo": e.g. when pasted into
a Terminal window, this next works: cd /s; sudo tar xf /dev/rdisk3 ./v/new.
