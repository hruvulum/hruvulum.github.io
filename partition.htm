all of these dups were made with `tar cf /dev/rdisk3 -T /c/dupt` unless
otherwise specified.

8-gig cruzer #1. currently in my book bag in a CVS ctr. bootable fedora workstation 
33 including gnome and a major browser.

8-gig cruzer #2. dup made 2020 Apr 20. currently at cata.

8-gig cruzer #3. dup made 2019 Nov 11. stored at cata. I tried something new
and used dd rather than (bsd) tar to write to the backup media. dd took over 8
hours.

also /o/dup/full/ on hdtera contains 8-gig dups. e.g., one made a few days before mbmm died.

on mbnuc: f2 for system setup, f10 to choose boot device, esc for systemd-boot's menu.

when pasted into a Terminal window, this next works: cd /s; sudo tar xf 
/dev/rdisk3 ./v/new. if you run tar as non-root, it will convert the owner of the extracted
files to the invoking user. if run as root, it will preserve the ownership data in the
archive (but that behavior can be overridden with flags).
