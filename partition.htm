this file has the extension "htm" because I do not know how to configure github
pages to publish with the extension "txt".

the most recent dup goes here.

2021-11-11. the new portable ssd, 500 gigs, Samsung T7 :: 48-gig encrypted 
ext4 partition.

2021-10-03. 8-gig cruzer #1. location as of 2021 Oct 28: ewater hallway cubby.
dup of /da. although in the future I can prol do better than tar, and although
running tar as root might've been the wrong move, I used `sudo tar` to make a
tarball and then to extract the tarball onto a freshly created encrypted ext4
according to the method in /c/dup.

2021-07-20. 8-gig cruzer #2. location as of 2021 Oct 28: cata. dup of /da
made by the method described in /c/dup. then I made a tarball as follows
(advantage: I could check the approximate space requirements quickly) then
untarred the ball into a subdirectory of the newly formatted volume.

    cd / && time sudo tar -c -f da.tar --exclude=dup_btr ./da

2021-03-23. the only big partition (partition 3) on hdmm2 (an ssd drive
currently inside mbnuc). btrfs dups made 2021 Mar 23 and 2021 Mar 20.

2021-03-13. partitions 1 and 2 on the nvme drive have dups made 2021 Mar 12 or
13.

2021-03-11. 8-gig cruzer #3. location: cata lr (as of 2021 Oct 03). dup made
using tar.

2021-03-11. the 16-gig tiny stainless drive. Fedora 34 prerelease everything
(netinst) install iso file. used to install what I am using now.

2020-11-30. mbmm's /o (1-terabyte hard drive). current location: on the top
shelf of the hall closet at cata. (ditto the failing original 500-meg hard
drive of mbmm.) contains 8-gig dups. e.g., one made 2020 Apr 14.

if you run tar as non-root, it will convert the owner of the extracted files to
the invoking user. if run as root, it will preserve the ownership data in the
archive (but that behavior can be overridden with flags).
