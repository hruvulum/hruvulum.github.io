I tried something new and used dd rather than (bsd) tar to write to
the backup media. dd took over 8 hours.

also /o/dup/full/ on hdtera contains 8-gig dups. e.g., one made 2020 Apr 14.

to boot from a usb drive, press and hold the option (alt) key immediately upon
hearing the startup chime. release the key after Startup Manager appears.
